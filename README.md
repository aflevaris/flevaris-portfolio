# Amber Flevaris - Portfolio

## About Me
Hi there! My name is Amber Flevaris (she/her). I'm a Pittsburgh native, studying in the Masters of Public Management part-time program at Heinz College. In addition to school part-time, I have worked full time at CMU in University Advancement for the last five years. My background is in arts and education fundraising (including a bachelor of science in sports, arts, and entertainment management from Point Park University), all in the Pittsburgh region. My ultimate goal is to run an arts non-profit in the city. I live in the Highland Park neighborhood with my husband, where we have spent most of the pandemic doing puzzles, watching Jeopardy, and rewatching every Pixar movie.  

## What I hope to learn
My work here at the university involves a lot of donor-related data, and I have found myself struggling to be able to convey it all visually. What excites me the most is learning how to master storytelling without explicitly telling the audience through words. I also hope to take all I've learned into future jobs, adding to my skillset. This is also my first time coding my own webpage (unless you count finangling the layout for my MySpace page in 2006!), which is exciting and another important experience.

Visualizing Government Debt: 

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6gPh" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6gPh" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2018</a></iframe>


Using Flourish, I was able to manipulate the above data to create the following visualization: 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/5282925"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/5283261"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

What makes the dot plot unique from the other two charts is its ability to compare all of the countries over time, emphasizing the story that overall, all country's debt percentage related to GDP has grown over the years. In particular, Japan has shown a significant rise from the mid-1990s to today. Highlighted are the US and Canada to show a comparison from Western countries that the audience may be more familiar with. The media has emphasized the high debt that the US has, which lends the reader to see how steep Japan has grown their debt in regards to percentage of GDP. The first graph does a good job at showing that Japan and the other countries in 2018, the second graph shows the progression of each of country over the years, but only the third graph shows both of those attibutes together.
