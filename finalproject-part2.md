# Final Project Part II

## Storyboards



## User Research

### Target Audience
The target audience for this story falls into a few categories: 
* University advancement leadership at universities in the United States whose goal is to learn new insights about ways to fundraise right now and into the future 
* Alumni and donors to universities with interest in the topic related to making their gifts and choosing which organizations to support 
* Students of universities who are interested in what institutions are doing as it relates to endowments and their tuition/future with the university 

Each of these different groups, who may be interested in the data, will also have different needs. It’s important for my users to represent each of these groups in some way. I want it to be accessible for someone very knowledgeable about the subject matter, like a staff member, as well as for those who may be invested in the subject but not as familiar with terms and trends (student or donor/alumni). 

### Identifying Users
JR 
 * CMU undergraduate alum and donor, male, age 25 
 * Contact method – In-person
 * As a donor, JR has limited knowledge, but full investment into how the university is doing and where fellow donors are giving. His perspectives are important to see how the average donor/alumni would interpret the story. 

YZ  
 * CMU university advancement leadership staff member and graduate alum, female, age 35  
 * Contact method – Via Zoom 
 * YZ would directly benefit from learning more about the data at other institutions and how the industry is trending. These visualizations could help her make a case for a shift in priorities for her programs at the university. It’s important that someone like YZ be able to understand the visualizations and story, as she has direct knowledge to university advancement. 

JI 
 * CMU undergraduate junior, female, age 20 
 * Contact method – Via Zoom 
* JI is very engaged as a student at the university, but is not familiar at all with how fundraising works. It will be important for a student with no knowledge of university advancement, but an interest in how the university can improve, can understand the story. 

### Interview Script
Introduction:
Thank you very much for sitting down with me today. 
Could you please state your age, job title/major, and affiliation with the university? 
I am going to give you a very short overview of the project I am asking for feedback on. I am in a class called “Telling Stories with Data” where we have been tasked to do just that – tell a compelling story by using data visualizations. 
Would you take the next minute to look over these data visualizations? As you are looking through, please write down any questions that come to mind. Once the time is up, I will address any questions you have and ask a few myself. Feel free to be open and honest with me! The goal of this is to improve my final project, which I can’t do without great constructive feedback.
