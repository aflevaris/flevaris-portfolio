### Final Insights - Part III
Taking all of the feedback I received in Part 1 and 2, I went into creating my Shorthand by using my moodboard as a guide for photos and general style. I used Lato as my font throughout as I found it to be the clean and easy to read. My photos came from the royalty-free website Pexels, where I was able to find the perfect photos of college students and greenery. I stuck with my theme of using bright greens and contrasted them with the use of white, black, and gray. As I went to finalize my graphs, I focused on Flourish, Infogram, and Canva, trying to create exciting visuals with the least amount of excess information.  

An important thing I learned from the user research was that my colleague, who has more experience with fundraising and seeing donor data, was able to resonate with the data more than the alumnus and student. This led me to narrow my focus from three audience types (fundraiser, student, and alumni) to just one main person: university leadership/staff who could use this data to make an impact at their organization. In truth, it was easier and less labor intensive to explain the graphs and data to someone with insider knowledge and experience than it would be to explain every aspect to a broader audience. After presenting, I felt that the professor understood the topic well enough that I didn't go to overboarding in using language like "planned giving." I also added in an additional graph from my storyboard proposal to depict the changing growth from 2019, 2019, and 2020. I talked a lot about 2020 fundraising, but didn't really show it visually. That graph was particularly helpful in showcasing how their was ultimately growth and lef into the call to action to keep the momentum going.
