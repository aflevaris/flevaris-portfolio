# About Me
Format: ![Amber Flevaris](file:///C:/Users/aflevari/Downloads/DSC_4954.jpg)

Hi there! My name is Amber Flevaris. I'm a Pittsburgh native, studying in the Masters of Public Management part-time program at Heinz College. In addition to school part-time, I have worked full time at CMU in University Advancement for the last five years. My background is in arts and education fundraising (including a bachelor of science in sports, arts, and entertainment management from Point Park University), all in the Pittsburgh region. My ultimate goal is to run an arts non-profit in the city. I live in the Highland Park neighborhood with my husband, where we have spent most of the pandemic doing puzzles, watching Jeopardy, and rewatching every Pixar movie.  

# What I hope to learn
My work here at the university involves a lot of donor-related data, and I have found myself struggling to be able to convey it all visually. What excites me the most is learning how to master storytelling without explicitly telling the audience through words. I also hope to take all I've learned into future jobs, adding to my skillset. This is also my first time coding my own webpage (unless you count finangling the layout for my MySpace page in 2006!), which is exciting and another important experience.
