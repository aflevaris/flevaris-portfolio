### Final Insights 
Taking all of the feedback I received in Part 1 and 2, I went into creating my Shorthand by using my moodboard as a guide for photos and general style. I used Lato as my font throughout as I found it to be the clean and easy to read. My photos came from the royalty-free website Pexels, where I was able to find the perfect photos of college students and greenery. I stuck with my theme of using bright greens and contrasted them with the use of white, black, and gray. As I went to finalize my graphs, I focused on Flourish, Infogram, and Canva, trying to create exciting visuals with the least amount of excess information.
