# Final Project - Amber Flevaris

## Outline

The focus of my project will be the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on university fundraising in the United States for 2020 and how to best recover from it in 2021. University fundraising was growing exponentially, until COVID-19 happened and now schools are scrambling to reclaim that growth. As a reader, I want to understand the affect the pandemic has had on university fundraising so that I can make changes to better regrow philanthropy at my institution. My call call to action is that they can do this by understanding trends in the industry such as focusing on student aid funds and university need as fundraising tools.

## Data

The data will come from a variety of sources, which work directly with universities to survey them and report out on the data that they receive. While some fundraising data is conifdential, organizations such as The Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), THe Chronice of Philanthropy, National Conference of State Legislatures, and Insider HigherEd publish some of their results. For any interesting topic that I cannot get large datatsets for, I will pull the data directly from the data visualizations that they have put forth in their reporting. I also have access to large datatsets from Carnegie Mellon, which I am able to use with permission from the University Advancement office. Below are a few sources I plan to use in my visualizations: 

CASE - Voluntary Support of Education for 2018-2019: https://www.case.org/system/files/media/file/VSE%20Research%20Brief%231_1.30.20_WEB.pdf
NCSL - Higher Education Responses to COVID-19: https://www.ncsl.org/research/education/higher-education-responses-to-coronavirus-covid-19.aspx
