# Final Project - Amber Flevaris

## Outline

The focus of my project will be the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on university fundraising in the United States for 2020 and how to best recover from it in 2021. University fundraising was growing exponentially, until COVID-19 happened and now schools are scrambling to reclaim that growth. As a reader, I want to understand the affect the pandemic has had on university fundraising so that I can make changes to better regrow philanthropy at my institution. My call call to action is that they can do this by understanding trends in the industry such as focusing on student aid funds and university need as fundraising tools. 

Below is an outline of the story:

-Introduction with data on University Advancement

-Data Analysis and Current Situation
---Growth in 2018-2019 for undustry as a whole
---COVID-19's impact on higher education in 2020, including furloughs, loss of donors 

-Examples of Growth 
---CMU's fundraising growth
---Opportunities and trends across the full industry

-Call to Action 
---Tools and trends to grow fundraising at your institution

## Data

The data will come from a variety of sources, which work directly with universities to survey them and report out on the data that they receive. While some fundraising data is conifdential, organizations such as The Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), The Chronice of Philanthropy, National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), and Insider HigherEd publish some of their results. For any interesting topic that I cannot get large datatsets for, I will pull the data directly from the data visualizations that they have put forth in their reporting. These trusted sources in the industry will help me tell the story of the past, present, and future of fundraising in higher education. I also have access to large datatsets from Carnegie Mellon, which I am able to use with permission from the University Advancement office. 

Below are a few sources I plan to use in my visualizations:
